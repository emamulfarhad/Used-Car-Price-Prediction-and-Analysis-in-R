# Used-Car-Price-Prediction-and-Analysis-in-R

Data collected from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/cardataset 

In recent days the significant number of used car users has increased. In this case, many new used car company has been established. But the problem is pricing.
For any type of business, pricing plays the most significant role. If the pricing is perfect, then the company can also grow fast. Thatâ€™s why there are so many
studies on pricing. With the advanced big data (Machine learning) technique it is easy to predict the price based on past data analysis. Humans can mistake to predict the price because so many factors are involved to predict price. However, a predefined model can easily predict the price based on recorded past data.
This project will predict the used car price. 

Dataset Description:

The independent variables: Make, Model, Year, Engine Fuel Type, Engine HP, Engine Cylinders, Transmission Type, Driven Wheels, Number of Doors, Market Category, Vehicle Size, Vehicle Style, highway MPG, city MPG, and Popularity. 

The dependent variable or target variable: MSRP.

Two different models including Multiple regression and Random forest used to predict the car price
